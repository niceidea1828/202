        processing, including profiling. You can object to our use of your
        personal data where we stated we rely on our legitimate business

        Personal Information from them at any time. Likewise, we encourage
        children to consult with their parents before submitting any information

        in the online activities of their children and suggest that parents do
        their best to provide their children with a safe and friendly online
